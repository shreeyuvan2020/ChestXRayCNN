Download all files first and go to the folder path through terminal, you can also do this in vs code terminal by opening code file up in vs code.
All imports below can be installed through "pip install -r requirements.txt", this will install all required dependencies for this project.
Then run Main.py through "python Main.py" to initialize data and MAP, please acknowledge that this will take some time.

Then run "python -m streamlit run app.py" as this is opens the website and is where the inference is run, running the file normally will not work with Streamlit, after you run this command it will give you the local website url where you can test it, have fun!
